Oud Inventory Manager

Project Overview
Oud Inventory Manager is a secure web application for fragrance sellers that allows tracking and managing oud oils, attars, and perfume blends. The system allows users to add new products, view all inventory, update product details, and delete items that are no longer available. This project demonstrates a full CRUD application using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB/Mongoose, and EJS templating.
Purpose of Application
Oud oils are pricey, rare, and exist in multiple types and sizes; this makes inventory tracking crucial for any business owner. This application replaces the need for manual tracking with a digital system that categorizes oud products, maintains stock levels, tracks pricing, and keeps supplier information easily accessible. It ensures the user always knows precisely what inventory is available, stopping potential issues with stock errors or product losses.
Target groups
Small fragrance or oud shops
Enthusiasts
Online oud/attar sellers
